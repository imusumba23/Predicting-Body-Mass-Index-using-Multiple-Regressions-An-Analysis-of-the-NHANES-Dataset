This project focuses on developing a model to accurately predict an individual's body mass index (BMI) using the variables provided in the NHANES dataset. The project utilizes multiple regression techniques and conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationship between BMI and various predictors. By employing multiple regression techniques and EDA, the project aims to identify the most significant predictors of BMI and assess the model's effectiveness in predicting BMI value

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is an ongoing survey conducted by the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to assess the health and nutrition status of the American population. The dataset used in this project was collected during the years 2009-2010 and 2011-2012, comprising information on approximately 5,000 individuals of all ages. The participants were interviewed in their homes and completed a health examination as part of the survey.
